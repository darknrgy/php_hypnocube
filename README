The main interface to the hypnocube lives in hypnocube.class.php. You will also need a utility called serproxy, available from 
http://www.lspace.nildram.co.uk/freeware.html. The hypnocube interface talks through serproxy, which is a serial port -> socket 
adapter. 

This is a pretty badly organized bit of code that I made for my own amusement and uploaded to git-hub as my first project there. 
Use at your own risk.
